Keysas-admin application
*************************

.. note:: 

 **Keysas-admin** is a desktop application that allows you to manage your **Keysas** stations.
 You can manage your Public Key Infrastucture, register new stations, update them, sign USB devices and much more.

.. warning:: 

 **Keysas-admin** only work on GNU/Linux based systems for now !
 To be able to sign USB devices with your current user, 
 create a new udev rule **/etc/udev/rules.d/71-keysas.rules** with the following:
 **SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"**

SSH configuration
=================
First, start by creating a **Ed25519** private key and the associated public key on your computer
This keypair should only be dedicated to the administration of your Keysas stations. To do so, open a terminal and use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell-session
 
 ssh-keygen -m PEM -t ed25519 -f mykey

.. warning:: 
 The application currently does not support passphrase management or the PKCS#12 format. 
 Therefore, you need to enter an empty passphrase by pressing Enter. 
 Similarly, the enrollment and revocation features of Yubikeys are not yet supported by the application.

Then, set the path of both keys in the **"Admin configuration->SSH configuration"** menu

Generate a IKPQPKI
==================
To be able to sign your outgoing USB devices and to enroll new Keysas stations, you need to create a **IKPQPKI**
(Incredible Keysas (Hybrid) Post-Quantum Public Key Infrastucture). This is a PKI basically 😁
If you have never created a **IKPQPKI**, go to **"Admin configuration->IKPQPKI configuration"** and click on **"Create a new IKPQPKI"**

Provide the information requested to build your own custom PKI.
Be patient, this may take a while !

Enroll you Keysas stations
==========================
You can now start adding new **Keysas** stations in the **"Add a new Keysas"** menu providing a name and an IP address
When done, export the **public SSH** key by clicking the **"Export SSH pubkey"** button for each station added.

In the menu, go to **"Manage your registered stations"**, click on more, provide your **IKPQPKI** **password** then click on **"Enroll"**
Be patient, this may take some time !

Sign your outgoing USB keys
===========================
Before starting, you must add a new **udev** to allow your current user wrting USB devices.

.. code-block:: shell-session
 
 # Add the the new udev rule:
 echo 'SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/71-keysas.rules
 # Then, add your current user to the disk group:
 usermod -aG disk $LOGNAME

You can now start signing at least one USB device in **"Admin configuration->USB Signing"**.
Type the **password** provided during your **IKPQPKI** creation, plug the USB key and wait !
Once again, be patient, this may take a while !
Now format your USB key using mkfs.xxx in a terminal:

.. code-block:: shell-session
 
 sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1 #For example

If your **Keysas** station has been previously enrolled, your signed USB key should be now recognized by the station.

You're now ready to go !
