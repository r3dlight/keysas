# USB virus cleaning station

# Main features

- Retrieve untrusted files from USB (via keysas-io) or over the network
- Perform multiple checks
  - Run anti-virus check (ClamAV)
  - Run Yara parsing
  - Run extensions and size checks
- Signatures (for scanned files and USB keys)
    - Trusted (Outgoing) USB devices must be signed with Keysas-admin application
    - Each verified file signature is stored in the corresponding file report (.krp) 
    - Signatures are post-quantum proof (hybrid Ed25519/Diltithium5 scheme)
    - Private keys are stored using PKCS#8 format
    - x509 certificates are signed by the internal PKI (using Keysas-admin)
- Authentication
  - Users can be authenticated using personal Yubikeys 5

## Architecture

<div align="center">
<img  src ="img/keysas-core-architecture.png"  alt="keysas-core architecture"  width=900px/>
</div>

Files are passed between daemons as raw file descriptors and using abstract sockets (GNU/Linux only). Each daemon adds metadata and sends it to the next daemon using a dedicated abstract socket. Finally, the last daemon (Keysas-out) chooses whether or not to write the file to the output directory according to the corresponding metadata. For each file, a report is systematically created in the output directory (sas_out).

 - Daemons are running under unprivileged users
 - Daemons are sandboxed using systemd (Security drop-in)
 - Daemons are sandboxed using LandLock
 - Daemons are sandboxed using Seccomp (x86_64 & aarch64)

## Other binaries or applications available

 - Keysas-admin: Desktop application for remotly managing several Keysas stations (Tauri application). It also provides an hybrid post-quantum PKI to sign USB outgoing devices, sign certificat signing requests (csr) from Keysas stations.
 - Keysas-io: Daemon watching udev events to verify the signature of any mass storage USB devices and mount it as a IN (no or invalid signature) or OUT device (valid signature).
 - Keysas-sign: Command line utility to import PEM certificate via Keysas-admin
 - Keysas-fido: Command line utility to manage Yubikeys 5 enrollment
 - Keysas-backend: Create a websocket server to send different json values to the keysas-frontend
 - Keysas-frontend: Readonly Vue.js Frontend for the final user
 - Keysas-firewall (WIP): Provide a Windows 10 application to verify that documents have been signed by a Keysas station.
